# Projects

## Manipulation with Robot Arms
[[GitHub](https://github.com/SIGRobotics-UIUC/lerobot)]

We use LeRobot, Huggingface's robotics library, alongside the Alex Koch 3D-printed robot arms to perform object manipulation tasks using imitation learning.

See more examples [here](https://x.com/adv8p/status/1838255612691390677) and [here](https://x.com/adv8p/status/1831748218054701112)

## TB3 Manipulator
We're using Turtlebots to do to do a variety of tasks, such as getting Advait coffee, navigating around the ACM room, and mapping Siebel. 

## Low-Cost Mobile Manipulator
We're currently developing our own low-cost, open-source, mobile manipulator in collaboration with [Huggingface LeRobot](https://huggingface.com). And open-source it.

## Mini Humanoid
We're training locomotion policies with our own 3D-printed miniauture humanoid, sponsored by [KScale Labs](https://kscale.dev/).

## Simulation
Perform a variety of robotic tasks, such as humanoid locomotion, pick-and-place, and navigation, in simulation using MuJoCo.
