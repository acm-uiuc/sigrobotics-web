# Projects

## Manipulation with Robot Arm
[[GitHub](https://github.com/SIGRobotics-UIUC/lerobot)]

Manipulate objects using robot learning on 3D-printed arms.

See examples [here](https://x.com/adv8p/status/1838255612691390677) and [here](https://x.com/adv8p/status/1831748218054701112)

## Mobile Manipulation
Use Turtlebots to do to do a variety of tasks, such as getting Advait coffee, navigating around the ACM room, and mapping Siebel. 
We're also developing our own low-cost mobile manipulator, which we plan to open-source.

## Simulation
Perform a variety of robotic tasks, such as humanoid locomotion, pick-and-place, and navigation, in simulation using MuJoCo.
